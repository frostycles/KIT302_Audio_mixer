# KIT302_Audio_mixer
A program to splice audio signals with bacground noise.

Installation:
The noise folder location has been ignored to reduce on file size to comit to github.
Because of this if you are part of the EARS team, you can find the folder with all the noise audio in the team drive.
If you are not, you will have to get your own (Sorry).

When you have your noise files you want to mix, put them in a file called 'noise'.

Place this folder into the data folder so it is alongside the 'mixed' and 'signal' folders.

You will also need to get signal files (these are the speach or base audio filse you want tho mix.
You can either place them in the date/signal folder or you can change the file path in the code to a specific file location on your PC.

Lastly, all mixed files will be saved to the data/mixed folder.
This can be changed in the code if you have another place you would preffer.

Hope this helps explain its installation.
